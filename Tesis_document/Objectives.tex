\chapter{Aims}

The analysis above leads us to the following general and specific objectives:

\section{General Objective}

To develop a single-trial indirect functional connectivity framework, accompanied by regularized deep learning approaches, to extract pertinent subject-specific non-linear spatio-temporal-frequency patterns from non-stationary EEG data, improving the MI-BCI system's accuracy and interpretability.

\section{Specific Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1] To develop a single-trial indirect FC for enhanced nonlinear feature extraction, preserving the spatio-temporal-frequency interpretability while favoring the classification performance in MI-BCI and avoiding spurious connectivities.
 
	\item[2] To extend the proposed single-trial FC within a deep learning scheme that handles artifacts and EEG representations, necessitating minimal preprocessing efforts from raw signals.
 
	\item[3] To develop a transparency and interpretability strategy dedicated to MI-BCI classification that emphasizes spatial-temporal-spectral pattern domains, incorporating a qualitative and quantitative relevance analysis assessment.
\end{itemize}
